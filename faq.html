					<strong>Q: what are my hobbies?</strong>
					<br>
					<p>
					A: i played soccer for seven years. i wasn't good enough for my HS varsity team so I stopped playing it. 
					
					<br>
					<br>
					this led me to a crippling valorant and <a href="https://op.gg/lol/summoners/na/delayeddash-2048">league of legends addiction </a>
				
					<br>
					<br>
					but also eventually led me to focus more on academics which I think helped with getting into my dream college.
					
					<br>
					<br>
					i made a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1k5f3du/
					deleted_by_user/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_
					name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">reddit post</a> about it. it was kind of embarassing so i deleted it. but it was true.

					<strong>do you listen to music?</strong>
					<br>
					Q: YES. i started in middle school when i listened to the radio while doing my homework. over time i found various online communities that gave me music recommendations.
					then i started the classic pipeline: youtube playlists --> wait <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/8d48jika6l3243pnzo7y3xwjc">spotify</a> is better --> i want to make good playlists to share --> youtube reviewers (watch toddintheshadows!) --> 
					i want to make my own reviews --> <a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/user/badmusictakes/">rateyourmusic.com layout sucks.</a>
					<br>
					<br>
					i also played the piano for two years. playing an instrument doesn't make you like music though. the true way is to be forced to listen to the same five hot 100 
					pop songs everytime you turn on the radio.
